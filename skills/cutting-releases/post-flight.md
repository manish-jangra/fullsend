# Post-Flight Verification

Part of the [cutting-releases](SKILL.md) skill.

Run after the version tag is pushed, the `v0` tag is moved, and the
CI workflows complete. Focus on the areas identified during pre-flight
step F.

## A. Wait for CI workflows

Wait for the Release workflow (triggered by the `v*` tag) and the
Sandbox Images workflow (triggered by the `v0` tag move) to complete:

```
gh run list --workflow=release.yml --limit=1
gh run list --workflow=sandbox-images.yml --limit=1
```

Both must pass before proceeding. If either fails, investigate and
resolve before continuing — a broken release or sandbox image affects
all downstream consumers.

## B. Verify the release artifacts

```
gh release view <tag>
```

Check that the title, changelog, and binary assets look correct.
Verify the release is not marked as a draft.

## C. Note on fullsend-ai repos

The `fullsend-ai/.fullsend` repo references reusable workflows via
`@main`, not `@v0`. Its runs do **not** exercise the `v0` tag and
cannot confirm that the tag move worked. (Those runs are checked
during pre-flight instead, as a signal that `main` is healthy.)

Skip fullsend-ai for post-flight `v0` verification. Focus on other
downstream consumers in step D.

## D. Check additional downstream repos (optional)

Use `AskUserQuestion` to ask if the user has access to additional
downstream orgs:

> Do you have access to any other downstream orgs/repos to verify?
> (e.g. "konflux-ci, redhat-developer/rhdh-agentic")
> Leave blank to skip.

For each repo provided, check recent workflow runs that started
**after** the `v0` tag move:

```
gh run list --repo <org/repo> --limit=5
```

Confirm they completed without workflow-resolution errors (e.g.
"could not find reusable workflow"). If no runs occurred naturally,
check for recent failed runs that can be retriggered:

```
gh run list --repo <org/repo> --status=failure --limit=3
```

Present any candidate to the user for confirmation before retriggering.

If blank, skip this step — not all admins have access to every
enrolled org.

## E. Present post-flight summary

Summarize results to the user:

| Org/Repo | `@v0` Refs | Status |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| ... | ... | ... |

Note: `fullsend-ai` repos are excluded from this table — they use
`@main` and were checked during pre-flight.

Distinguish between:
- **Release-related failures** — workflow resolution errors, missing
  secrets, or permission failures caused by the tag move.
- **Unrelated failures** — agent runtime errors, external API issues,
  or pre-existing test failures.
