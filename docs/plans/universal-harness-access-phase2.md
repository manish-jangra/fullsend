# Implementation Plan: Phase 2 — Transitive Dependency Resolution

## Context

Phase 1 (MVP) of ADR-0038 is fully shipped (8 PRs merged). It added URL detection, SSRF-hardened fetching, content-addressed caching, audit logging, schema extensions, resource resolution, and CLI integration. Phase 1 treats all URL-referenced resources as **leaf nodes** — a fetched skill cannot itself reference other URL-based resources.

Phase 2 removes this limitation. URL-referenced skills can declare `dependencies:` in their YAML frontmatter, and the resolver will recursively fetch and validate those transitive dependencies. This enables skill composition: a "rust-conventions" skill can depend on a "cargo-integration" skill and a "rust-sandbox" policy without requiring the harness author to enumerate every transitive dependency.

Design details are in `docs/plans/universal-harness-access.md` (sections "Transitive Closure", "Relative Path Resolution for URL-Referenced Resources", and "Dependency Graph and Resolution"). The ADR is at `docs/ADRs/0038-universal-harness-access.md`.

> **Scope note:** The design doc envisions transitive resolution for all resource types (agents reference skills, skills reference policies, policies reference schemas). Phase 2 limits transitive resolution to skills only — agent and policy resources are treated as leaf nodes. Extending to other resource types is deferred to a future phase if needed.

## PR Dependency Graph

```
PR 1 (skill frontmatter parser) ──> PR 2 (recursive resolver + relative URL resolution) ──> PR 3 (CLI wiring + flags)
```

PRs are strictly sequential. Each is independently reviewable and safe to merge alone — earlier PRs introduce new code with no callers until the subsequent PR wires them in.

## PR 1: Skill frontmatter parser — extract `dependencies:` from SKILL.md

**Scope:** New package `internal/skill/` with a parser that extracts YAML frontmatter from SKILL.md content (bytes, not files). Pure functions with no callers. Zero risk to existing behavior.

**Rationale for new package:** Skill frontmatter parsing is a distinct concern from harness loading (`internal/harness/`) and resource resolution (`internal/resolve/`). Placing it in its own package avoids circular dependencies: `internal/resolve/` will import `internal/skill/`, but `internal/skill/` imports nothing from the resolve or harness packages.

**Create `internal/skill/skill.go`:**

```go
package skill

// SkillMeta holds parsed YAML frontmatter from a SKILL.md file.
type SkillMeta struct {
    Name         string   `yaml:"name"`
    Description  string   `yaml:"description,omitempty"`
    Dependencies []string `yaml:"dependencies,omitempty"`
    Policy       string   `yaml:"policy,omitempty"`
}

// ParseFrontmatter extracts the YAML frontmatter block (delimited by "---")
// from SKILL.md content and unmarshals it into SkillMeta. Returns a zero-value
// SkillMeta (no error) if the content has no frontmatter. Returns an error only
// if frontmatter is present but malformed.
//
// Frontmatter format:
//   ---
//   name: rust-conventions
//   dependencies:
//     - ../common/cargo-integration/SKILL.md
//     - https://github.com/fullsend-ai/skills/security-baseline/SKILL.md#sha256=abc123...
//   policy: policies/rust-sandbox.yaml
//   ---
func ParseFrontmatter(content []byte) (SkillMeta, error)
```

Implementation notes:
- Split content on `---` delimiters (first line must be `---`, find second `---`).
- Use `gopkg.in/yaml.v3` to unmarshal the frontmatter block.
- Return `SkillMeta{}` (no error) if the first line is not `---` — this handles plain Markdown skills with no frontmatter.
- The `Dependencies` field holds raw reference strings (URLs or relative paths). Resolution is the caller's responsibility.
- The `Policy` field is a single reference string for skill-level policy (also resolved by the caller).

**Create `internal/skill/skill_test.go`:**

Test cases:
- **Valid frontmatter with dependencies:** Parse skill with `dependencies:` list, verify all entries extracted.
- **Valid frontmatter without dependencies:** Parse skill with `name:` but no `dependencies:` — returns empty `Dependencies` slice.
- **No frontmatter:** Plain Markdown content (no `---` delimiter) — returns zero-value `SkillMeta`, no error.
- **Malformed YAML in frontmatter:** Invalid YAML between `---` delimiters — returns error.
- **Frontmatter with policy field:** Parse skill with `policy:` field, verify extracted.
- **Mixed URL and relative dependencies:** Verify that raw strings are preserved as-is (no resolution at this stage).
- **Empty frontmatter block:** `---\n---\n` with nothing between — returns zero-value `SkillMeta`, no error.
- **Content after frontmatter:** Verify Markdown body after the closing `---` is ignored.
- **Existing SKILL.md format compatibility:** Parse a real SKILL.md from the repo (e.g., `skills/merge-queue/SKILL.md`) — existing fields (`name`, `description`, `allowed-tools`) are parsed without error; existing fields not in `SkillMeta` (like `allowed-tools`, `disable-model-invocation`) are silently ignored by `yaml.v3`'s default behavior (no `KnownFields(true)` is set).

**Depends on:** Nothing

**After merge:** Frontmatter parser available. No callers. All existing tests pass.

## PR 2: Recursive resolver with cycle detection and depth/breadth limits

**Scope:** Extends `internal/resolve/resolve.go` to recursively resolve transitive dependencies declared in fetched SKILL.md files. Modifies existing resolver internals but does not change the `ResolveHarness` public signature or behavior for harnesses without transitive dependencies. Harnesses with only local paths or single-level URL references continue to work identically.

### Changes to `internal/resolve/resolve.go`

**Add new types:**

```go
// resolveState tracks shared mutable state across recursive resolution calls.
// A single resolveState is created per ResolveHarness invocation and threaded
// through all recursive calls.
//
// Cycle detection uses two-phase DFS tracking to distinguish true cycles
// (A→B→A) from valid DAG diamond patterns (A→B→D, A→C→D). The inProgress
// set tracks URLs on the current call stack; resolved tracks fully processed
// URLs. A URL encountered in inProgress is a cycle; a URL in resolved is a
// diamond and is skipped without error.
type resolveState struct {
    inProgress    map[string]bool       // URL -> true while on the current DFS stack
    resolved      map[string]Dependency // URL -> result, fully processed (skip on re-encounter)
    resourceCount int                   // total resources fetched so far
    deps          []Dependency          // accumulated resolved dependencies
}
```

**Add to `ResolveOpts`:**

```go
type ResolveOpts struct {
    WorkspaceRoot string
    FetchPolicy   fetch.FetchPolicy
    TraceID       string
    AuditLogPath  string
    MaxDepth      int // Maximum recursion depth (default: 10)
    MaxResources  int // Maximum total resources per harness (default: 50)
}
```

Default constants:

```go
const (
    DefaultMaxDepth     = 10
    DefaultMaxResources = 50
)
```

`MaxDepth` and `MaxResources` are passed through directly from the CLI flags (which default to 10 and 50 respectively). Setting `MaxDepth` to 0 disables transitive resolution entirely.

> **Note:** The design doc's pseudocode placed `MaxDepth`/`MaxResources` in `FetchPolicy`. We place them in `ResolveOpts` because they are resolution-time concerns (graph traversal limits), not per-fetch concerns (timeouts, retries, size limits).

**Modify `ResolveHarness`:**

The public signature remains unchanged: `ResolveHarness(ctx, h, opts) ([]Dependency, error)`. Internally, it now creates a `resolveState` and passes it to `resolveURL`, which calls a new `resolveTransitiveDeps` function after fetching each skill.

```go
func ResolveHarness(ctx context.Context, h *harness.Harness, opts ResolveOpts) ([]Dependency, error) {
    state := &resolveState{
        inProgress: make(map[string]bool),
        resolved:   make(map[string]Dependency),
    }
    maxDepth := opts.MaxDepth      // 0 = no transitive resolution
    maxResources := opts.MaxResources

    // Resolve top-level fields (agent, policy, skills) at depth 0.
    // Same logic as Phase 1, but resolveURL now accepts state and depth.
    // ... (existing iteration over h.Agent, h.Policy, h.Skills)

    return state.deps, nil
}
```

**Modify `resolveURL`:**

Add `state *resolveState`, `depth int`, `maxDepth int`, and `maxResources int` parameters. After fetching and caching a skill URL, call `resolveTransitiveDeps`.

```go
func resolveURL(ctx context.Context, field, rawURL string, h *harness.Harness,
    opts ResolveOpts, state *resolveState, depth, maxDepth, maxResources int) (Dependency, string, error)
```

Key changes inside `resolveURL`:
1. **Already resolved (diamond) check:** If `state.resolved[cleanURL]` exists, return the cached `Dependency` immediately — no fetch, no budget consumed. This handles DAG diamonds (A→B→D, A→C→D) efficiently.
2. **Cycle detection:** Check `state.inProgress[cleanURL]`. If true, return error: `"circular dependency detected: %s"`. This catches true cycles (A→B→A) because `inProgress` tracks the current DFS call stack.
3. **Breadth check:** Verify `state.resourceCount < maxResources`. If exceeded, return error: `"exceeded maximum resource count of %d"`. This runs after the diamond/cycle checks so that revisited URLs do not consume budget.
4. **Mark in-progress and increment:** Set `state.inProgress[cleanURL] = true` and `state.resourceCount++`.
5. **Guard on resource type:** Only call `resolveTransitiveDeps` for skill-type resources. Check `strings.HasPrefix(field, "skills")` before calling. Agent and policy resources skip this step — their content may contain `---` delimiters (especially YAML policy files) that `ParseFrontmatter` would misinterpret.
6. After successful fetch/cache (for skills only), call `resolveTransitiveDeps(ctx, cleanURL, content, h, opts, state, depth, maxDepth, maxResources)`.
7. **Mark resolved:** After resolution completes, delete from `state.inProgress` and store the result in `state.resolved[cleanURL]`.

**Add `resolveTransitiveDeps`:**

```go
// resolveTransitiveDeps parses a fetched skill's frontmatter for dependencies
// and recursively resolves them. Only called for skill-type resources (SKILL.md).
// Agent and policy resources are leaf nodes and do not declare dependencies.
func resolveTransitiveDeps(ctx context.Context, parentURL string, content []byte,
    h *harness.Harness, opts ResolveOpts,
    state *resolveState, depth, maxDepth, maxResources int) error
```

Logic:
1. **Depth check:** If `depth+1 > maxDepth`, return error: `"exceeded maximum dependency depth of %d at %s"`.
2. **Parse frontmatter:** Call `skill.ParseFrontmatter(content)`. If error, return wrapped error. If no dependencies, return nil (leaf node).
3. **Resolve each dependency reference:**
   - If the reference is an absolute URL (`harness.IsURL(ref)`): use as-is.
   - If the reference is a relative path: resolve relative to `parentURL` using `ResolveRelativeURL(parentURL, ref)` (defined in `relurl.go` below).
   - Recursively call `resolveURL(ctx, field, resolvedRef, h, opts, state, depth+1, maxDepth, maxResources)`.
4. **Resolve policy reference:** If `meta.Policy != ""`, resolve it the same way (but do not recurse into it — policies are leaf nodes).

**Backward compatibility:** For harnesses with no URL-referenced skills, `resolveTransitiveDeps` is never called. For URL-referenced skills whose content has no `dependencies:` frontmatter, `ParseFrontmatter` returns an empty `SkillMeta` and the function returns immediately. Phase 1 behavior is preserved exactly.

### New file: `internal/resolve/relurl.go`

```go
// ResolveRelativeURL resolves a relative reference against a parent URL's
// base path, following RFC 3986 semantics. The parent URL is the URL from
// which the containing resource was fetched.
//
// Examples:
//   ResolveRelativeURL("https://github.com/org/skills/rust/SKILL.md", "../common/SKILL.md")
//   → "https://github.com/org/skills/common/SKILL.md"
//
//   ResolveRelativeURL("https://github.com/org/skills/rust/SKILL.md", "policies/sandbox.yaml")
//   → "https://github.com/org/skills/rust/policies/sandbox.yaml"
//
// Security: The resolved URL is returned as-is. The caller must validate it
// against allowed_remote_resources prefixes (which operates on the normalized
// URL, preventing path traversal attacks like ../../../../attacker-org/evil).
func ResolveRelativeURL(parentURL, relRef string) (string, error)
```

Implementation:
1. Parse `parentURL` with `net/url.Parse`.
2. Parse `relRef` with `net/url.Parse`.
3. Use `parent.ResolveReference(rel)` (Go's `net/url` implements RFC 3986 reference resolution, including `..` normalization).
4. Return `resolved.String()`.

This is deliberately simple — the security boundary is enforced by the existing `MatchingAllowedPrefix` check in `resolveURL`, which operates on the fully resolved and normalized URL. Path traversal via `../../../attacker-org/` is caught there, not here.

### New file: `internal/resolve/relurl_test.go`

Test cases:
- **Sibling reference:** `../common/SKILL.md` relative to `.../skills/rust/SKILL.md` resolves to `.../skills/common/SKILL.md`.
- **Child reference:** `policies/sandbox.yaml` relative to `.../skills/rust/SKILL.md` resolves to `.../skills/rust/policies/sandbox.yaml`.
- **Absolute URL reference:** `https://other.com/skill.md` is returned unchanged (no resolution against parent).
- **Path traversal:** `../../../../attacker/evil.md` relative to `.../org/skills/rust/SKILL.md` resolves to `https://github.com/attacker/evil.md` (valid URL — the caller's prefix check rejects it).
- **Multiple `..` segments:** `../../other/sub/SKILL.md` resolves correctly.
- **Fragment preservation:** `../common/SKILL.md#sha256=abc123` resolves with the `#sha256=...` fragment intact. Integrity checking depends on the fragment surviving `url.ResolveReference`.
- **Trailing slash handling:** Parent URL without trailing filename component.

### Updates to `internal/resolve/resolve_test.go`

New test cases (in addition to existing Phase 1 tests, which remain unchanged):

- **Transitive dependency resolution:** Skill A depends on Skill B (via frontmatter). Verify both are fetched, both appear in `deps`, and harness skills list includes both resolved cache paths.
- **Two-level transitive resolution:** Skill A depends on Skill B, Skill B depends on Policy C. Verify all three are fetched.
- **Diamond dependency (no false positive):** Skill A depends on Skill B and Skill C; both B and C depend on Skill D. Verify D is fetched exactly once, no cycle error, and D's cache path appears only once in `h.Skills`.
- **Cycle detection:** Skill A depends on Skill B, Skill B depends on Skill A. Verify error contains "circular dependency".
- **Self-referencing skill:** Skill A depends on itself. Verify error contains "circular dependency".
- **Depth limit exceeded:** Chain of dependencies deeper than `MaxDepth`. Verify error contains "exceeded maximum dependency depth".
- **Breadth limit exceeded:** Skill with more than `MaxResources` dependencies. Verify error contains "exceeded maximum resource count".
- **No frontmatter (leaf node):** URL-fetched skill with plain Markdown (no `---`). Verify it resolves as a leaf node with no transitive fetches (same as Phase 1).
- **Empty dependencies list:** Skill with `dependencies: []` in frontmatter. Verify no transitive fetches.
- **Transitive dependency not in allowlist:** Skill A depends on Skill B at a URL outside `allowed_remote_resources`. Verify error contains "not in allowed_remote_resources".
- **Transitive dependency hash mismatch:** Skill A depends on Skill B; Skill B's content doesn't match its declared hash. Verify error contains "integrity check failed".
- **Mixed local and transitive:** Harness with local skills and one URL skill that has transitive deps. Verify local skills are untouched, URL skill and its transitive deps are all resolved.
- **Policy in skill frontmatter:** Skill declares `policy:` in frontmatter. Verify the policy is fetched and resolved.
- **Relative URL in dependency:** Skill at `https://example.com/skills/rust/SKILL.md` declares dependency `../common/SKILL.md`. Verify resolved to `https://example.com/skills/common/SKILL.md` and fetched.

**Depends on:** PR 1 (imports `internal/skill`)

**After merge:** Resolver supports transitive dependencies. Not yet wired into CLI (the CLI still calls `ResolveHarness` the same way, but transitive resolution now happens automatically for any URL-fetched skill that declares `dependencies:` in its frontmatter).

---

## PR 3: CLI wiring — transitive deps in sandbox upload + relative URL integration

**Scope:** Wires transitive dependency resolution into the CLI run flow. Ensures transitively resolved skills are uploaded to the sandbox alongside directly referenced skills. Adds `--max-depth` and `--max-resources` flags.

### Changes to `internal/cli/run.go`

**Add CLI flags:**

```go
cmd.Flags().Int("max-depth", 10, "maximum dependency depth for transitive resolution")
cmd.Flags().Int("max-resources", 50, "maximum total remote resources per harness")
```

The flag defaults match `DefaultMaxDepth` and `DefaultMaxResources`. Setting `--max-depth 0` disables transitive resolution entirely (no recursion). `ResolveOpts` no longer uses `0` as a sentinel — the CLI always passes the explicit flag value.

**Modify `runAgent()`:**

Between `h.ResolveRelativeTo(absFullsendDir)` and `h.ValidateFilesExist()`, the existing code currently calls `resolve.ResolveHarness`. Update the `ResolveOpts` to pass through the new limits:

```go
deps, err := resolve.ResolveHarness(ctx, h, resolve.ResolveOpts{
    WorkspaceRoot: workspaceRoot,
    FetchPolicy:   fetchPolicy,
    TraceID:       traceID,
    AuditLogPath:  auditLogPath,
    MaxDepth:      maxDepth,      // from --max-depth flag
    MaxResources:  maxResources,  // from --max-resources flag
})
```

**Modify skill upload loop:**

After `ResolveHarness` returns, `deps` now contains both direct and transitive dependencies. The harness `h.Skills` list already contains resolved local paths for direct skills (both local and URL-resolved). However, transitive skill dependencies are recorded in `deps` but not in `h.Skills`.

Two approaches (recommend Option A):

**Option A: ResolveHarness appends transitive skills to `h.Skills`.**
The resolver already modifies `h` in place (replacing URL fields with cache paths). Extend this: when a URL-fetched skill declares transitive skill dependencies, append the resolved cache paths to `h.Skills`. This way, the existing skill upload loop automatically handles transitive skills with no changes to `run.go`'s upload logic.

In `resolveTransitiveDeps`, after resolving each skill dependency (from `meta.Dependencies`, not `meta.Policy`):
```go
// Append transitively resolved skills to the harness Skills list
// so the existing upload loop picks them up. The resolved check in
// resolveState prevents diamond dependencies from appending duplicates.
h.Skills = append(h.Skills, localPath)
```

Policy references from `meta.Policy` are resolved and added to `state.deps` but are **not** appended to `h.Skills` — they are a different resource type. The `state.resolved` map ensures diamond dependencies (A→B→D, A→C→D) do not append D's cache path twice: `resolveURL` returns early for already-resolved URLs before reaching the append.

**Option B: Separate transitive deps in the upload loop.**
Iterate `deps` separately and upload any transitive skill deps not already in `h.Skills`. This keeps the resolver from modifying `h.Skills` beyond what the user declared, but requires more changes to `run.go`.

**Recommendation:** Option A. The resolver already modifies `h` in place (that's its documented contract). Appending transitive skills is consistent with this pattern and keeps `run.go` simple.

### Changes to `internal/resolve/resolve.go`

Pass the harness `h` through to `resolveTransitiveDeps` so it can append to `h.Skills`. This means `resolveTransitiveDeps` now takes `*harness.Harness` as a parameter (it was already available via the call chain, just needs to be threaded through).

### Security scanning of transitive dependencies

Transitive dependencies pass through the same security pipeline as direct dependencies:
- Fetched content is integrity-checked (hash verification) before caching.
- The existing `scanRepoContextFiles` function in `run.go` walks the sandbox's skill directories and scans all `SKILL.md` files found. Since transitive skills are uploaded to the sandbox as skill directories, they are automatically scanned.
- No additional scanning code is needed — the existing infrastructure handles it.

### Test updates

**Modify `internal/cli/run_test.go`:**
- `--max-depth` flag registration test.
- `--max-resources` flag registration test.

**Depends on:** PR 2

**After merge:** `fullsend run` supports transitive dependency resolution end-to-end. Example working harness:

```yaml
agent: agents/code.md
policy: policies/code.yaml
skills:
  - skills/local-skill
  - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fullsend-ai/library/8cd3799.../skills/rust-conventions/SKILL.md#sha256=abc123...
allowed_remote_resources:
  - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fullsend-ai/library/
```

Where `rust-conventions/SKILL.md` contains:

```yaml
---
name: rust-conventions
dependencies:
  - ../cargo-integration/SKILL.md#sha256=def456...
  - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fullsend-ai/library/8cd3799.../skills/common/formatting/SKILL.md#sha256=ghi789...
policy: policies/rust-sandbox.yaml#sha256=jkl012...
---
# Rust Conventions skill content...
```

The resolver will:
1. Fetch `rust-conventions/SKILL.md`, verify hash, cache it.
2. Parse its frontmatter, discover 3 transitive dependencies.
3. Resolve `../cargo-integration/SKILL.md` relative to the parent URL.
4. Fetch and cache all 3 transitive dependencies (each with hash verification and allowlist checks).
5. Append all resolved cache paths to `h.Skills`.
6. The sandbox upload loop uploads everything.

---

## Security Considerations

### Cycle detection

The resolver uses two-phase DFS tracking to distinguish true cycles from valid DAG diamonds. The `inProgress` set tracks URLs currently on the DFS call stack; `resolved` tracks URLs that have been fully processed.

- **True cycle (A→B→A):** When resolving B's dependencies, A is found in `inProgress` → error: "circular dependency detected".
- **Diamond (A→B→D, A→C→D):** When resolving C's dependencies, D is found in `resolved` (not `inProgress`) → D's cached result is returned immediately, no re-fetch, no error, no budget consumed.

**Edge case:** Two different URLs serving identical content share a cache entry (content-addressed), but cycle detection operates on URLs, not content hashes. `A.md -> B.md -> A.md` is a cycle. `A.md -> B.md` where B has the same content as A is not a cycle.

### Depth limit

Maximum recursion depth defaults to 10 (configurable via `--max-depth`). This bounds the worst-case resolution time and prevents pathologically deep dependency chains. The depth counter increments at each recursive level. A skill at depth 10 that declares dependencies triggers an error before any of those dependencies are fetched.

### Breadth limit

Maximum total resources defaults to 50 (configurable via `--max-resources`). This counts all remote resources fetched per `ResolveHarness` call (direct + transitive). It prevents dependency explosion attacks where a skill declares 100 dependencies, each of which declares 100 more.

### Relative URL path traversal

When a skill at `https://github.com/org/skills/rust/SKILL.md` declares a dependency `../../../../attacker-org/evil/SKILL.md`, RFC 3986 resolution produces `https://github.com/attacker-org/evil/SKILL.md`. This URL passes the domain allowlist check (same domain), but **fails** the `allowed_remote_resources` prefix check:

```yaml
allowed_remote_resources:
  - https://github.com/org/skills/
```

The normalized URL `https://github.com/attacker-org/evil/SKILL.md` does not match prefix `https://github.com/org/skills/`. The fetch is rejected.

**Critical:** The prefix check in `MatchingAllowedPrefix` operates on the **normalized** URL (after RFC 3986 `..` resolution), not the raw relative reference. This is already implemented in Phase 1 and applies to transitive dependencies without modification.

### Transitive dependency allowlist enforcement

Transitive dependencies must satisfy the same `allowed_remote_resources` constraints as direct dependencies. There is no separate allowlist for transitive deps — the harness-level allowlist (which itself must be a subset of the org-level allowlist) governs all fetches, direct or transitive. This is enforced in `resolveURL`, which checks `h.MatchingAllowedPrefix` for every URL regardless of depth.

### Integrity hash requirement

Transitive dependency references in SKILL.md frontmatter must include `#sha256=...` integrity hashes, just like direct references. The existing `ParseIntegrityHash` validation in `resolveURL` enforces this uniformly. A dependency reference without a hash is rejected with a clear error message.

### Aggregate fetch latency

With `MaxResources=50` and the existing 30-second per-fetch timeout, the worst-case wall-clock time for a cold resolution is ~25 minutes (50 sequential fetches, each timing out). In practice, most fetches complete in under a second and dependency graphs are shallow, so this is unlikely. A total wall-clock timeout for the entire `ResolveHarness` call is a reasonable future addition but is not included in Phase 2 — the existing per-fetch timeout and breadth limit provide sufficient protection for now.

## Verification

After PR 3 merges, verify Phase 2 end-to-end:

1. **Unit tests:** `make go-test` — all new and existing tests pass.
2. **Lint:** `make lint` passes.
3. **Local-only harness (regression):** Run an existing harness with only local paths — no behavioral change from Phase 1.
4. **Single-level URL harness (regression):** Run a harness with URL-referenced skills that have no `dependencies:` frontmatter — same behavior as Phase 1.
5. **Transitive dependency resolution:** Create a test harness referencing a URL-hosted skill whose SKILL.md frontmatter declares `dependencies:` with another URL-hosted skill. Verify both skills are fetched, cached, and uploaded to the sandbox.
6. **Relative URL resolution:** Create a skill that references a dependency via a relative path (`../common/SKILL.md#sha256=...`). Verify the relative reference is resolved against the parent URL and fetched correctly.
7. **Cycle detection:** Create two skills that reference each other in their `dependencies:`. Verify the resolver fails with a "circular dependency" error.
8. **Depth limit:** Create a chain of skills deeper than 10 levels. Verify the resolver fails with a "exceeded maximum dependency depth" error. Verify `--max-depth 3` lowers the limit.
9. **Breadth limit:** Create a skill that declares more than 50 transitive dependencies. Verify the resolver fails with a "exceeded maximum resource count" error. Verify `--max-resources 5` lowers the limit.
10. **Transitive dep not in allowlist:** Create a skill whose transitive dependency URL is outside `allowed_remote_resources`. Verify rejection with "not in allowed_remote_resources" error.
11. **Transitive dep hash mismatch:** Create a skill whose transitive dependency has a wrong hash. Verify rejection with "integrity check failed" error.
12. **Audit log:** Verify that transitive dependency fetches produce audit log entries with `fetch_type: "static"` and correct `allowed_by` values.
13. **Offline mode with transitive deps:** Pre-populate cache for all transitive dependencies, then run `fullsend run --offline`. Verify cache hits succeed. Remove one transitive dep from cache and verify failure.
