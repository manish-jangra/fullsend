# 40. Org pool for parallel e2e tests

Date: 2026-05-19

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The e2e tests exercise the full admin install/uninstall flow against a live
GitHub org using Playwright browser automation
([ADR 0010](0010-stored-session-for-e2e-browser-auth.md)). Each run creates
GitHub Apps, repos, secrets, variables, and enrollment PRs — then tears them
all down. These operations are destructive and non-reentrant: two concurrent
runs targeting the same org will collide on shared resources (`.fullsend` repo,
org secrets, app slugs) and fail unpredictably.

With a single test org, CI runs are serialized. A push to `main` and an
in-flight PR both trigger e2e, but only one can proceed; the other waits or
fails. As the contributor count grows this becomes a bottleneck.

## Decision

Maintain a pool of identically-configured GitHub orgs (currently `halfsend-01`
through `halfsend-06`). Each e2e run acquires exclusive access to one org
before proceeding, using a lightweight distributed lock implemented as a
purpose-built repo (`e2e-lock`) within each org.

**Acquisition:** The test runner shuffles the pool (to avoid thundering herd)
and scans each org, attempting to create the `e2e-lock` repo. Repo creation
is atomic on GitHub — if it succeeds, the caller holds the lock. A
`README.md` in the lock repo contains the run's UUID for ownership
verification. During the first pass, stale locks from crashed runs are
detected and force-acquired (see Staleness below). If all orgs are locked,
the runner falls back to round-robin polling every 30 seconds with a
configurable timeout (`E2E_LOCK_TIMEOUT`, default 10 minutes). Each poll
iteration also checks for stale locks.

**Release:** On test completion (pass or fail), the runner deletes the
`e2e-lock` repo, but only after verifying the UUID matches — preventing a
run from releasing another run's lock.

**Staleness:** If a runner crashes without releasing its lock, the lock repo's
`created_at` timestamp provides an age signal. A lock older than
`staleLockTimeout` (15 minutes) is considered stale and force-acquired. A
fresh lock (under 1 minute old) resets the wait timer.

Adding new orgs to the pool requires only provisioning the GitHub org (with
the shared test account as owner) and appending its name to the `orgPool`
slice in the test code. No architectural changes are needed.

## Consequences

- Up to N e2e runs execute in parallel, where N is the pool size.
- Each org must be pre-provisioned with the test account as owner and a
  `test-repo` for enrollment testing.
- A crashed run leaves a stale lock that self-heals via the age-based
  staleness check.
- The single `botsend` test account and its stored browser session are shared
  across all orgs; session export and PAT creation remain per-run.
- Pool expansion is an operational task (provision org, update one slice
  literal), not an architectural change.
